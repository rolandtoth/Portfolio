The previous website of the Hungarian actor Imre Baksa was among my first works and it was rather static. Now it has been fully redesigned and a CMS was used to make content dynamic.

Behind the scenes ProcessWire CMS serves the content and it does a wonderful job. It's still a joy to work with and makes backend tasks ridiculously easy.

On the front-end the jQuery plugin Isotope makes blocks appear in a "packery" style layout. Additionally, items are opened in a lightbox which allows quick access to pages without navigating away.

The sidebar on the left features a large knob to filter items by years, and some other buttons to filter items by type. All these make browsing the site a unique experience and fun.
