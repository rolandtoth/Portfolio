Started out as a facelift of an existing project but soon turned into a larger-scale redesign. The customer supplied a well-thought wireframe and functional brief so we could concentrate on the graphics and on the new features.

My role was creating the visual design and the front-end development. I like this kind of combination because there is better control on the final result. We went for a clean, easy-to-digest interface that is unobtrusive but unique. Mission completed?

The site's core functionality, the flash-based Designer was also updated to make it fit into the new look. There are also plans to switch to a JavaScript or HTML5 based Designer in the near future.
