DropIt is an open source tool for sorting files and folders easily. Though I'm listed as a developer at their sourceforge page I contributed only some minor things to the project, such as html list templates (CSS only, no images), creating the Hungarian translation, reporting bugs and disturbing real developers requesting new features.

A blog was launched to provide usage tips to users, for which I post articles regularly.

I'm proud to see the project evolving and being part of it!
