This is a simple application built on ProcessWire and html2canvas.js for creating menu images to post on Facebook.

The client requested a Microsoft Word template to edit weekly menus and save it as an image. I suggested another approach instead: an online editor. Even though it took more time to develop it was worth the trouble. It's very easy to use even though it has bilingual content.

It takes only a few steps to create a menu:

-   load an existing menu
-   double-click on a line to edit in a front-end editor lightbox
-   enter meal details and save
-   click on the Preview button and if all's fine, then click on Download
-   share on Facebook (or use elsewhere)

I'm happy I could convince them and that it's working great for years now.
