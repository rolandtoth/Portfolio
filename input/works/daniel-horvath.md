A multilanguage, responsive website that features scrollable sections to make a great first impression - and even greater consecutitve ones with animations, sliders and interesting visual solutions. The project required much more frontend work than backend but this was not surprising with the amount of animation involved.

A custom quiz was also needed that was fun to build. I've used my [FrontEndEditLightbox](https://github.com/rolandtoth/FrontEndEditLightbox) module to give editors easy access for editing different parts of the site which made things really straightforward and faster to them.

I think that visual elements nicely assist in promoting content, and overall, the site is fun to use. But do not believe me, visit to check!
