We were after a catchy but mature web design because one part of the site is a general introduction while others are for kids and parents. The bold top menu and the slight radial gradient play nicely together and create a nice frame that suits well for both purposes.

Product pages share the same graphical elements but they are a bit more playful thanks to the various pets and fruits floating around. The main slider is also of a kind that one simply can't stop clicking on it because it just feels so great :)
