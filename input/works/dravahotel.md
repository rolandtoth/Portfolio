The hotel is located next to Harkány Bath and Thermal Spa in quiet, forested surroundings encircled by an enormous green area with stately trees. Unfortunately their old design was less charming and the site was running on an outdated proprietary CMS.

We picked ProcessWire as the main CMS because it handles multilanguage very well. Localization was an important feature as the majority of the guests are foreigners. Currently the site has six languages and most of the content is localized thanks for the enormous work of the content editors. As a developer my task was to provide tools for them but fortunately it was easy with ProcessWire.

Another important goal was responsiveness as nowadays most traffic comes from handheld devices. The site includes several forms and integrated third party reservation services too.

Design-wise I tried to achieve something cosy using the hotel's CI colors and design elements, with large images and easy navigation.

After the go-live we got many positive feedbacks and the number of reservations grew to previously unknown heights, which was very nice to hear.
