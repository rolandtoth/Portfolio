Website created for 4Elements Natural Energy Drinks with custom 3D cans created by me. The rendered images were the major graphic elements on the site, apart from the logo which was created by PAQART.

I used ProcessWire for the underlying CMS which worked perfectly. Unfortunately the project didn't make through but the website was a joy to build. This was one of the last projects I created with PHP and ProcessWire before I switched to C# and frontend frameworks. It had all the goodies I collected at that time: lazy loading assets, caching, fast page load and so on.
