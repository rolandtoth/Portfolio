3 years after the previous launch of PAQART website (which was my very first ProcessWire project btw) they decided to do a full brand overhaul which involved a fresh new website too. The design was made by another in-house designer who insisted on a very minimalistic look. This generated a few extra challenges but nothing that I couldn't solve with ProcessWire (and some brainwork).

I'm really happy with the outcome - not only the frontend but also the backend looks clean and simple. Adding or updating content is a snap even for non-tech users. Under the hood many of my custom modules are helping with this, which wasn't available back then (TemplateLatteReplace, AdminOnSteroids, MarkupSrcSet, etc). It's nice to see how they assist in making content management easier and cut development time.
