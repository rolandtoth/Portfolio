It's hard to create an outstanding winery design with so many great sites out there. Fortunately the client could provide great imagery that I could use to establish the mood.

Wine labels were designed by PAQART and we put them on 3D-rendered bottles (shameless promo: modeled/rendered by me). This way it was easy to put them over any kind of background, eg. over a photo in a slider or over a dark one on a product page.

I think that the nice images and the SPA-like home page reflects the Espák family philosophy of tradition, movement and their love towards producing quality wine.
