I designed the site with simplicity and speed in mind. The round logo and the minimalistic look provides a fresh and clean atmosphere. The large Budapest cityscape images in the header emphasizes the organization's main goal: "contribute in any possible way to make Hungary a better country".

As usual, only vanilla JavaScript was used. In fact it's not a script-heavy site so there was really no need to pull in a library like jQuery.

The Monthly Lunches and Members Area were the only parts that seemed trickier at first. At the end of the day it turned out that those were easy to solve thanks to ProcessWire's excellent features and flexibility.
