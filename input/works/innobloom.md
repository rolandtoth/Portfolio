There's nothing fancy in the design but it's still catchy thanks to the big and parallax'ed header images, the fixed inverted top navigation and smooth scrolling. Of course it's fully responsive, and only the required assets are loaded on smaller screen sizes to keep visitors' mobile traffic low.

The site is built on ProcessWire CMS and performs really well on website speed tests. We used vanilla JavaScript, srcset for images and other tricks to make it as speedy as possible. Forms are made with a custom form module that features live validation, character counter, autocomplete inputs and even autogrow textareas.

It was fun to build and I really like the outcome. Such level of optimization took some serious efforts here and there and I have learnt a lot of new techniques.
