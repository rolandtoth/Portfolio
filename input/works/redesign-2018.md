A portfolio redesign is always a nuisance if you take it to heart. I was designing my site for about 2 years but I was never satisfied enough. I ended up leaving the design as it was because I had no big complaints against. On the other hand I really wanted to replace WordPress. I feel having a WordPress site as a developer is less professional, so to speak.

I wanted to use ProcessWire but when I read about Eleventy I couldn't wait to get my hands dirty. It's a static site generator and my portfolio seemed a perfect project to try. It took a few hours to get familiar with how it works and to sketch up my site. However, it took a few days more to iron out some issues and make some design adjustments.

It was a joy seeing how lean was the output: only static HTML files and the assets, altogether under 5Mb - the old version weighed above 100 Mb. Of course this time I took a more minimalistic approach and used up-to-date techniques (the previous site was about 5 years old). Because of this the site is very fast and looks much better imo.

I'm very happy with the outcome and that I have found Eleventy, it's a great and easy-to-use tool that I will surely use in smaller projects.
